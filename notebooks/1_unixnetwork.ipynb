      "Unix-based operating systems form the backbone of the Internet. However, Unix is often used as a command line operating system. Thus there are a number of useful commands and tools that allow you to explore the networked world, to connect to remote computers, and to move data between systems. In this lesson, we will explore:\n",

      "When using a web browser, you are likely familiar with finding resources by entering a human readable name, like google.com or illinois.edu. Computers only work with numbers, however, so in reality networks operate by associated names to numbers. The formal specification for this is currently known as [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6). THe former specification, [IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) provided a four byte address for a computer on a network. Many of the commands we use still display the more easily understood IPV4 format. The mapping between human readble name (like google.com) and an IP address used by computers is handled by the domain name service (DNS).\n",

      "The following list summarizes some of the more useful Unix network commands:\n",

      "### `ping`\n",

      "    $ ping google.com\n",
      "   \n",
      "### `traceroute`\n",

      "## Secure Shell\n",
      "\n",
      "With the growth of the Internet, standard mechanisms for network communication needed to be made more secure. This led to the development of the cryptographic network protocol for secure communications between two systems. Secure Shell (SSH) allows a user to securely connect to a remote system or to securely trasnfer files. The later functioantiiliy is generally done by using the Secure Shell cp `scp` or Secure Shell ftp `sftp` commands.\n",
      "\n",
      "SSH relies on public-private key pairs to enable ronbust compression. These keys are generated by the [`ssh-keygen`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-keygen) command.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Secure connection\n",
      "To connect to a remote computer by using SSH, we simply need to have our remote username and the remote system name:\n",
      "    $ ssh profbrunner@data.illinois.edu\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of the connection process, you will be required to enter your password on the remote system. When you connect for the first time (or if a machine name has changed its IP address) you may be presented with a warning message requesting that you double check the machine to which you are trying to connect. One example of where this can be important is to prevent a _man-in-the-middle_ attack where a hostile entity changes the IP-name mapping so that you are directed to connect to a system different than what you expect.\n",
