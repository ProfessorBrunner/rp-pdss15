    "\n",
    "A standard [Unix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) system provides a\n",
    "command-line interface to allow a user to interact with the underlying\n",
    "hardware. While this may lack the ease of use most modern graphical\n",
    "operating systems provide, a command line has several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flexible and powerful access to the underlying hardware\n",
    "2. Interactions are identical between local and remote hardware\n",
    "3. Commands can be connected or their input/output redirected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard command-line interface on a Unix system is provided by a\n",
    "program called a _shell_. While several different shells exist, one of the\n",
    "more popular is the [Bash\n",
    "shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)), which is what we\n",
    "will use by default in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "A shell allows a user to run (multiple) programs, to redirect the input\n",
    "and output from programs, and to connect programs together by using\n",
    "pipes. They also allow a user to move around the filesystem, and to\n",
    "automate basic processing by writing small programs known as shell\n",
    "scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands are entered at the shell prompt. In this course, we can have\n",
    "one of three different shell prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The JupyterHub Server terminal prompt, which is something similar to\n",
    "`data_scientist@temp_host:~$`.\n",
    "2. The Host operating system prompt, which for boot2docker is\n",
    "`bash-3.2$`, which is provided by the Boot2Docker application on Mac OSX\n",
    "or Windows.\n",
    "3. The Docker container system prompt, which looks identical to the\n",
    "JupyterHub Server Terminal prompt, but is obtained by connecting to a\n",
    "running docker container from within a host shell.\n",

    "## The Unix Process Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix operating systems support running multiple processes at the same\n",
    "time. In fact a central tenet of Unix is that the sum is greater than\n",
    "the individual parts, or the combination of multiple running parts gives\n",
    "greater strength. Even if a user has no running processes, the system\n",
    "itself will have a number of processes running. A process is identified\n",
    "by a process identifier, or `pid`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Several Unix commands are available for working directly with processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### `ps`\n",
    "used to find out the processes that are current;y running. By default ps\n",
    "only list the user's processes, although flags can be used to list\n",
    "system processes or processes being run by other users (on a multi-user\n",
    "system).\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ ps\n",
    " \n",
    "### `top`\n",
    "used to continually monitor running processes to see how they are\n",
    "consuming resources (e.g., memory or cpu). To exit from a running `top`\n",
    "display, enter the `q` key.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ top\n",
    "\n",
    "### `kill`\n",
    "used to send a signal, including the terminate signal to a running\n",
    "process. To send a signal to a specific process you must have the\n",
    "correct pid (and have sufficient permission to send the signal). For\n",
    "example, to send the terminate signal to a running process with `pid` of\n",
    "323:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ kill -9 323\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Processes\n",
    "Unix allows a program to be run in the background, thereby allowing the\n",
    "user continue working in the current shell. You can automatically place\n",
    "a job in the background by adding an `&` at the end of the program\n",
    "invocation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ my-program &\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also halt a currently running program by entering `CTRL-Z` (the\n",
    "suspend signal), and subsequently sending it _into the background_ by\n",
    "entering `bg` at the new Unix prompt and hitting return. Likewise, you\n",
    "can bring a background job _to the front_ by entering `fg` and hitting\n",
    "return at the Unix prompt. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have more than one job running in the background, you can list\n",
    "running background jobs with the `jobs` command, which will list each\n",

    "Unix prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard Streams\n",
    "By default Unix processes read input from a standard input stream, known\n",
    "as `stdin`, write their output to a standard output stream, known as\n",
    "`stdout`, and report any error conditions to a standard error stream,\n",
    "known as `stderr`. By default, `stdin` is the keyboard, while `stdout`\n",
    "and `stderr` are the display. However, these can be changed as needed at\n",
    "the Unix command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Unix process model allows commands to be connected by employing a\n",
    "[Unix pipe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)) to connect the\n",
    "`stdout` of one command to the `stdin` of a second command. This process\n",
    "can continue, allowing multiple processes to be chained together into a\n",
    "pipeline. This concept will make more sense later when we have covered\n",
    "more Unix commands, but the basic syntax is to use the pipe character\n",

    "provides for data storage and retrieval from the underlying hardware, as\n",
    "well as interprocess communication through pipes. The Unix filesystem is\n",
    "based on a single rooted tree model. The root of the tree is known as\n",
    "the __root__ directory, and is denoted by the `/` character.\n",
    "Sub-directories branch off from this root directory to form the entire\n",
    "filesystem hierarchy.\n",

    "Files and directories have owners and groups (for example I am the owner\n",
