    "## Working with files\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with files, or any other system object, we must be careful\n",
    "about properly managing the underlying resource. In this particular\n",
    "case, that means a file and the associated file descriptor that the host\n",
    "operating system uses to reference the actual file. While modern\n",
    "operating systems can typically manage a very large number of file\n",
    "descriptors, when we use virtualization, like with a Docker container,\n",
    "we want to minimize our server footprint. Thus, we need to carefully\n",
    "husband resources like file descriptors to avoid exhausting our server\n",
    "resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "But a more important aspect is that whenever we open a file, we want to\n",
    "be sure that the file is properly closed, and that any data that a\n",
    "program wrote to the file has actually been written to permanent\n",
    "storage. Thus we need to ensure that every file that was opened has\n",
    "been properly closed. To open a file, Python has an `open` method that\n",
    "opens the named file and returns a file object that you either read from\n",
    "or write to depending on the mode used to open the file. Conversely,\n",
    "Python also has a `close` method that closes the file object. \n",
    "\n",
    "To explicitly state why a file is being opened, the `open` method\n",
    "accepts a _mode_ argument, whose default values is `rt` or _open for\n",
    "reading text data_. The allowed modes are detailed in the following\n",
    "table.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Mode | Description |\n",
    "| ---- | ----- |\n",
    "| 'r'  | reading (default) | \n",

    "| 'x'  | create and open file for writing |\n",
    "| 'a'  | writing, append to file if exists |\n",
    "| 'b'  | binary mode |\n",
    "| 't'  | text mode (default) |\n",
    "| '+'  | open for reading and writing |\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, and especially for the purposes of this class, we will only\n",
    "read from a text file or write to a text file when using traditional\n",
    "Python file input and output. Thus, to open a text file named `test.txt`\n",
    "for writing without truncating the existing file contents (i.e.,\n",
    "append), you would use `f = open('test.txt', 'a')` and after all\n",
    "operations on the file are complete, you would use `f.close()` to close\n",
    "the file and release all associated resources. One last item, when\n",
    "opening a file for reading and writing, the `+` mode follows either a\n",
    "`w` to open the file but truncate the file contents, or an `r` to open\n",
    "the file without truncation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python3, the approach to file input/output has changed with the\n",

    "rest of the line following the `with` command creates the actual context\n",
    "manages the entry into and exit from the enclosed code block. For our\n",
    "purposes, the standard application for a Python context is opening an\n",
    "closing files. As demonstrated in the following code block, we can now\n",

    "\n",
    "When called with an argument `Alexander`, this function will print\n",
    "`Hello Alexander`. Functions can take multiple arguments, they are\n",
    "simply separated by commas, and they can take data structures as\n",
    "arguments, like lists or tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def hellolist(names, text):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",

    "        print(\"Hello {0}, {1}\".format(name, text))\n",

    "\n",
    "If this function is called as \n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello Alex, welcome to class.\n",
    "Hello Joe, welcome to class.\n",
    "Hello Jane, welcome to class.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, a function accepts one or more arguments that often have\n",
    "_defualt_ values. Python supports default arguments that enable a Python\n",
    "programmer to specify a default value for an argument, which can be\n",
    "overridden if the user supplies a specific value. A default argument is\n",
    "specified by simply including an equal sign and the default value after\n",
    "a specific argument, like `text = ' welcome to class.'`. With this\n",
    "default argument for the `hellolist` function, we could leave off the\n",
    "second argument if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Default arguments are often used in functions that are part of large\n",
    "packages, like `numpy` or `matplotlib` to simplify their use. New users\n",

    "control of the function by specifying additional arguments explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keyword Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "One last aspect of function arguments is that when a function is called,\n",
    "the argument names listed in the function definition can be explicitly\n",
    "specified, along with the values they should take when the function is\n",
    "called. This type of function call is said to be using _keyword\n",
    "arguments_. When using keyword arguments, the order of the arguments\n",
    "listed in the function call is arbitrary and does not need to explicitly\n",
    "match the argument order listed in the function definition. For example,\n",
    "we could call the hellolist function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "hellolist(text=' welcome to class', names = ['Alex', 'Joe', 'Jane'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returning Values\n",
    "\n",
    "A function can return values by using the `return` keyword. Single\n",
    "values are returned as the type of the value, while multiple values are\n",
    "returned as a tuple of values. These two cases are demonstrated in the\n",
    "following sample code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def hello2():\n",
    "   return \"Hello World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def hello3(name):\n",
    "    return \"Hello, \", name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling the first function in this sample code as `msg = hello2()` will\n",
    "assign the string `Hello World!` to the `msg` variable, while calling\n",
    "the second of these functions as `msg = hello3()` will assign the tuple\n",
    "`('Hello', name)` to the `msg` variable. Note that for the `hello3`\n",
    "function, the argument is not required, as written, to be a string;\n",
    "therefore, the return tuple will have a string as the first element and\n",
    "the second element will be the same type as the argument `name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, when returning multiple values as a tuple, we can either enclose\n",
    "the values in parentheses, or simply separate them with commas as shown\n",
    "in the example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lambda Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also supports the ability to create unnamed functions, which are\n",
    "short functions that are defined and used in place. An unnamed function\n",
    "in Python is called a `lambda` function, and is defined by using the\n",
    "`lambda` keyword. lambda functions are often used in comprehensions or\n",
    "in function calls, when an argument expects a function. For example, we\n",
    "can create a `lambda` function that takes multiple arguments and assign\n",
    "to an arbitrary variable for later invocation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "f = lambda x, y: x**2 + y**3\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f(3, 4))\n",
    "\n",
    "73\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a lambda function to create a list comprehension, either\n",
    "implicitly with defined function like the previous example, or explicitly\n",
    "with an in-place `lambda` function. In either case, we can use the `map`\n",
    "function to apply the function to a range of input arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[x for x in map(lambda x: (3*x**2 + 2*x + 4), range(-3,4))]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Will create the following list: \n",
