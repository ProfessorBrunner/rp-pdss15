    "markdown files and IPython Notebooks that are documented by using\n",
    "Markdown cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this section, we will briefly review some of the more\n",
    "useful Markdown formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Header Text\n",
    "\n",
    "You can mark different sections of text by using different header levels\n",
    "(you can also use the IPython Notebook _Header_ cells). Markdown\n",
    "provides support for six header levels, which are generally marked by\n",
    "one or more hash `#` characters, where the number of hash characters\n",
    "indicates the header level. For example, to make a second level header\n",
    "text called _Markdown Cells_, you would use the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Markdown Cells\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Paragraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, you simply write text as normal for a document. Paragraphs are\n",
    "simply one or more lines that are enclosed in blank lines. If you need\n",
    "to insert a line break between two lins of text (sometimes useful when\n",
    "writing out lists), you simply add two or more blank spaces at the end\n",
    "of the line to break.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Emphasis\n",
    "\n",
    "You can easily indicate text that should be _italicized_ by enclosing\n",
    "the appropriate text in either single asterisk `*` characters or single\n",
    "underscore `_` characters. Likewise, for __bold__ text, you enclose the\n",
    "text in two asterisk `**` or underscore `__` characters. My personal\n",
    "preference is to underscore characters, for example the following\n",
    "Markdown text will first create __bold text__ followed by _italics text_:\n",
    "```\n",
    "first create __bold text__ followed by _italics text_\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "You can easily create two types of lists in Markdown: unordered and\n",
    "ordered, both of which can be nested. To make a simple unordered list,\n",
    "we simply prefix the list entries (that is a line) by a single asterisk\n",
    "`*`, dash `-`, or plus `+` character. To create a nested list, you\n",
    "indent the nested list by one or more spaces. For consistency, I prefer\n",
    "to use the dash `-` character to indicate unordered lists. For example,\n",
    "the following Markdown:\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Item 1\n",
    "- Item 2\n",
    " - Item 2.1\n",
    " - Item 2.2\n",
    "- Item 3\n",
    "````\n",
    "will produce the following list:\n",
    "- Item 1\n",
    "- Item 2\n",
    " - Item 2.1\n",
    " - Item 2.2\n",
    "- Item 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordered lists are similar, but are prefixed by numbers and a period, for\n",
    "example 1. for the first item. While the Markdown numbers do not have to\n",
    "start at one nor be sequential, the resulting text will be formatted to\n",
    "begin at one and proceed sequentially. For example, the following\n",
    "Markdown:\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Item 1\n",
    "4. Item 2  \n",
    "1. Item 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "will produce the following list:\n",
    "2. Item 1\n",
    "4. Item 2  \n",
    "1. Item 3\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representing code elements\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful features of Markdown is the ability to include\n",
    "formatted code directly in the text. Code elements can be included in\n",
    "two manners: inline, and block. Inline code elements are simply wrapped\n",
    "in single starting quote \\` characters (also called tick marks). For\n",
    "example, the Markdown \\`print(\"Hello World!\")\\` renders as `print(\"Hello\n",
    "World!\")`. Code blocks can also be placed on a single line with no quote\n",
    "characters by indenting the line four characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "For longer code blocks, you can enclose the block in three single quote\n",
    "characters \\`\\`\\`. For example, the following code block in Markdown:   \n",
    "\\`\\`\\`   \n",
    "x = 3  \n",
    "y = 4  \n",
    "z = 5   \n",
    "  \n",
    "print(\"%b\" % (x\\*\\*2 + y\\*\\*2 = z\\*\\*2)   \n",
    "\\`\\`\\`\n",
    "\n",
    "will produce the following code block:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 3  \n",
    "y = 4  \n",
    "z = 5   \n",
    "  \n",
    "print(\"%b\" % (x**2 + y**2 = z**2) \n",
    "```   \n",
    "\n",
    "You also can use what is known as\n",
    "github flavored Markdown to indicate the target program language by\n",
    "adding the language name after the initial three single quote\n",
    "characters. For example, to indicate Python, you would use \\`\\`\\`python,\n",
    "while to indicate Javascript, you would use \\`\\`\\`javascript.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quoting text\n",
    "\n",
    "You also can write quoted text by prefixing the line with a greater-than\n",
    "`>` character. You can also write multi-line block quoted text by\n",
    "prefixing every line with a greater-than `>` character. For example, the\n",
    "following Markdown:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\\> Here is a long line of text  \n",
    "\\> that we wrapped over multiple lines by inserting a Markdown line break  \n",
    "\\> that is of course multiple space characters inserted at the end  \n",
    "\\> of a line.\n",
    "\n",
    "will produce the following formatted text:\n",
